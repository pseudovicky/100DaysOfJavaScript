## Operators in JavaScript 

## 1. Arithmetic Operators :-

    +     Addition
    -     Subtraction
    *     Multiplication
    **    Exponentiation
    /     Division
    %     Modulus
    ++    Increment
    --    Decrement


## 2. Assignment Operators :-

    =      x = y
    +=     x = x+y
    -=     x = x-y
    *=     x = x*y
    /=     x = x/y
    %=     x = x%y
    **=     x = x**y


## 3. Comparison Operators:- 

    ==   equal to
    !=   not equal 
    ===  Equal value and type
    !==  not equal value or not equal type
    >    Greater than
    <    Less than
    >=   Greater than or equal to
    <=   less than or equal to
    ?    ternary Operator

# 4. Logical Operators :-

  &&  logical and
  ||  logical or
  !   logical not

# 5. Bitwise operators:- 

Apart from these, we also have type and bitwise operators. bitwise operators perform bit by bit operations on numbers.
eg:- 7+8 = 15 
where 7 and 8 is an operads and + operator .
