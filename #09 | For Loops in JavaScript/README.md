# chapter 3 Loops And Functions 

We use loops to perform repeated actions. 
for eample - If you are assigned a task of printing numbers from 1 to 100, it will be very hectic to do it manually, loops help us  automate such tasks.

## Types of loops in JavaScript

for loop - loop a block of code no of times
for in loop - loops through the keys of an object
for of loop - loops through the values of an object
while loop - loops a block based on a specific condition
do while loop - while loop variant which runes atleast once

##1. The for loop

The syntax of a for loop looks somethings like this
  for(statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3){
    // code to be executed
  }

statement 1 is executed one time
statement 2 is the condition base on which
statement 3 is executed everytime the loop body is executed
