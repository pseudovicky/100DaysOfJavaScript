# Chapter 5 = Arrays

Arrays are variables which can hold more than one value.

  const fruits = ["Bnana", "Apple","grapes"]
const a1 = [5, "Vicky","false"]

### Accessing values 
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,89]
numbers[0] -> 1
numbers[6] -> 89

### Finding the length
let numbers = [1, 7, 9, 21]
               0  1  2  3
numbers[0] -> 1
numbers.length -> 4

### Changing the values
let numbers = [7, 2, 5, 40, 9]
