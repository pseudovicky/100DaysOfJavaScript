# Conditional Statement 

Sometimes we might have to execute a block of code based off some condition.
For example a prompt might ask for the age of the user and if its greater than 18 display a special message.

## In JavaScript we have three forms of if.... else statement :-

1. if statement 
2. if...else statement
3. if...else..if...else statement
