# Conditional Statement 

Sometimes we might have to execute a block of code based off some condition.
For example a prompt might ask for the age of the user and if its greater than 18 display a special message.

## In JavaScript we have three forms of if.... else statement :-

1. if statement 
2. if...else statement
3. if...else..if...else statement

## if statement

The if statement in javascript looks like this
if(condition){
  //execute this code
}

The if statement evaluates the condition inside the () if the condition is evaluated to true, the code is not executed.


### if- else statement

The if statement can have an optional else clause. The syntax looks like this
if(condition){
  // block of code if condition true
}else{
  // block of code if condition false
}

if the condition is true, code inside if iss executed else code inside else block is executed
