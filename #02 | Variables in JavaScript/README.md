# Chapter 1 -  Variables and Data Types 

### Just like we follow some  rules while speaking english(the grammar), we have some rules to follow while writing a javascript program. The set of these rules is called syntax in javascript.

## What is a Variable ?
### A Variable is a container that store a value. This Is very similar to the container used to store rice, water and oats. 
### The value of a javascript variable can be changed during the execution of a program.

### var a = 7; --> literal
### let a = 7; --> Declaring Variables
###    (a) indentifier 
###    (=) assignment operators

## Rules for choosing variable names 

### - letter, digits, underscores & sign allowed.
### - Must begin with a $ _ or a letter
### - javascript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name 
### vicky and VICKY are different variable (case sensitive).

## var  vs let in javascript

### var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped.
### var can be update &  re-declared within its scope.
### let can be updated but not re-declared.
