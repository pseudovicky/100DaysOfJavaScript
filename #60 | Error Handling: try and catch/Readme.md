# Error Handling

We all make mistakes also sometimes aur script can have errors. Usually a program helps when an error occures.

The try... catch syntax allows us to catch errors so that the script insted of dying can do some things more reasonable.

## The try... catch syntax 
The try catch syntax has two main blocks: 
try and then catch 
try {
    // try the code 
} catch(error){
    //
}
