Classes and Objets
In object oriented programming, a class is an extensible program code template for creating objects, providing initial code for state ( member variable ) and inplementation of behavior ( member functions).

The basic system for writing a class is :

Class myClass {
    // class methods
    constructor () {...}
    method() {...}
    method(){...}
}

we can them use new MyClass( ) to create a new object with all the listed methods .

The constructor method
The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialige the object there.

Quick Quig : Create a class user and create a few methods along with a constructor. 

Class Inheritance : Class inheritance is a way for onw class to extend another class. This is done by using the extendd Reyword
