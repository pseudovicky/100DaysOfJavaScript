# Chapter 4 - Strings

Strings are used to store manipulate text. string can be created using the following syntax.

let name = "Vicky"

### Template Literals

Template literals are backtics instead of quotes to define a string.

let name = "vicky"

With template literals it is possible to use both single as well as double quotes inside a string

let sentance = ` The name "is" Vicky's `
(``) backtick    ("") double quotes   (') single quote

we can insert variables directly in template literal. This is called string interpolation
